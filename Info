The app is made on thunkable using the microsoft integreated azure.


The app works of any API (not less than 14) of Android.
The Blocks for the same is on my hand. 
Any one looking forward to follow up can, join the cause!
I will start working on the app on Android Studio 3.0.1 soon.
Hope everything turns out fine.
